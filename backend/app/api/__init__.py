# This file initializes the API module and sets up the necessary configurations.

# As there are no imports, globals, functions, or classes specified,
# this file will be left mostly empty. It serves as an initialization
# point for the API module.

# In a more complex setup, this file might include imports of API routes
# or blueprints, but for now, it remains empty to allow for future expansion.
